# Job Application Tracker

A simple **Job Application Tracker** built with Python and **CustomTkinter**. This application allows users to track job applications by adding new entries and viewing saved applications in a tabular format.

âœ… **View Applications** â€“ Display all saved job applications in a table with sorting and scrolling.  
âœ… **Save Data Locally** â€“ Applications are stored in a CSV file (`applications.csv`).  
âœ… **Simple UI** â€“ Built using `customtkinter` for a modern look.  
âœ… **Lightweight** â€“ No database required; uses CSV for simplicity.
